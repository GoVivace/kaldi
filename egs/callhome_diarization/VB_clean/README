1. You should prepare the initial rttm file in the rttm folder. And an example is
rttm/x_vector_rttm.  
2. You don't need to extract the MFCC feature again, but you need to train the
ubm again. The key thing is that apply cmn and add deltas will harm the
performance of the system.
3. When I convert the Kaldi model to numpy array. I used a command
ivector-extractor-copy, which is not supported by current Kaldi. So please use
my Kaldi.
